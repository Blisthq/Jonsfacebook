Today's Exercise: Crowd Sourced story written by my Facebook followers and friends.

The storyline concerns a Twilight-like romance between two teens, one of which has a secret. Describe the two main characters, the main events in the story, and what the secret is (hopefully not that one of them is a vampire).
